                <p>Theres no such thing as a bad question. Okay, maybe there is. But in an uncertain world, its okay to reach out, ask, learn, and grow. But what makes a question a good question? Are there situations we shouldn’t ask? Lets explore the world of questions.</p>

<p>Dumb questions may exist, but as the saying goes, there is no such thing as one. But, how we chose to ask for help matters more than sometimes what it is we are asking for. Remember that we live in a world where everything we ever need is in our pocket. A smartphone has google, and google is key. But lets get specific, and see where the path to a good question comes from. </p>

<p>I am at times an avid stack overflow user, so lets pick a question I have asked and decipher how to change the way I’ve asked it. </p>

<p><a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/170405/mdadm-raid-drive-rebuild-each-reboot">My Question</a></p>

<p>The link above is a question I asked about 3 years ago. I was learning how to build a RAID using linux, and was in a rush to see this project done. Lets dig in to how to make this better by imagining myself answer this question now.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A good title.</li>
</ol>

<p>From our reading about how to ask a good question, its evident that a good title is necessary. This helps an immediate understanding of the issue at hand. When looking at my question now, I can see how the verbage is very vague. Do I want it to rebuild at each boot? Or am I saying why is that happening? </p>

<ol>
  <li>Better Context</li>
</ol>

<p>I think my context is descriptive here, but its not written in the best layout. I do introduce methods I’ve looked at as well as some issues happening, but still I think I could have explained better. I’m showing my steps, but not describing what I am trying to achieve by doing them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sample Output</li>
</ol>

<p>I did an okay job here providing sample output. Remember that when asking a question, the person you are asking needs as much information as possible. With a good title and context, sample output can only help see the picture clearer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Less Motion*</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, this isn’t necessarily a rule - but I noticed how frustrated I was when asking this question. I feel a good question should not have that emotion attached to it, rather, needs to be a clear, concise question with a smooth path, rather than a jumpy one. I don’t think emotion does justice to questions in this case. </p>

<p>There may be no such thing as a dumb question, but we can ask them in a better way.</p>
