                    <h2>Cultural Change</h2>
                    <h4>03/21/2015</h4>
                    <p>Corporate, cut throat, narrow minded, or age favoring systems. These words describe any and all of the cultural experiences I have had in the workplace. It is unfortunate that so many systems focus more on the end result versus the process, creating a cultural black hole along the way. DBC is a fantastic learning experience that offers so much more than just "a package", as Shareef emphasized. At DBC, culture is everything; and in my mind, that is the front runner for the key to happiness in the work place.</p>

                    <p><strong>Play-Doh</strong>. Weird feeling, malleable, and cold, Play-doh infinitesimally fed the imagination. Like legos, Play-Doh was amongst the greatest hands on inventions of my childhood universe. It was non stop; the molding, mashing, building, sometimes eating, and always growing playtime. The greatest thing about Play-Doh was the very fact that I could sculpture anything I wanted. It didn't need to fit into other pieces, didnâ€™t need to be a certain shape, nor did it need to even make sense. All that mattered was pushing it onto the next piece, and continuously marvel at my ever growing creation.</p>
