                    <p>From my previous posts, we all know how and why programming in Ruby is awesome. Ruby is an object oriented language by design, meaning that everything is an object. What does this mean, and why does that matter?</p>

                    <p>"Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results." --Andrew Carnegie. Teamwork is an awesome feature of development today. I think its incredible how different perspectives and skills can help solve the same issue in very different and complimentary ways. Building with someone else isn't always the easiest thing to do, but can be the most rewarding.</p>

                    <p>Computers are intelligent. Theres no getting around that fact. Computers can do amazing things, and have only served to make what we can do as humans even better. However, much like I've alluded to before, computers are pretty awesome for doing more than flappy bird. Programming is an incredible feat to the tech world. As we go through this journey in DBC, I feel we are going to witness to just how incredible that feat gets.</p>

                    <h4>04/12/2015</h4>
                    <p>This is a hard one. Though some of us are new and unknowing, culture is just as important as the next best idea. Dane Atknsons, founder of SumAll, says it the best: "Culture is creating an environment in which your team members are owners of the process, so they're dedicated to the team in a different fashion." This might have different meanings to all of you, but whatever the interpretation may be, culture is a growing disconnect in the tech industry.</p>

                    <h4>04/05/2015</h4>
                    <p>We made it: 3 completed weeks! But what did these 3 weeks mean? I can't say I learned a lot, because most of this is more of a refresher to me. But that is not at all to discredit anything we have done. I did learn new methods for Ruby, and new ways to tackle specific problems - but I feel these 3 weeks were a chance to learn something more. Though these have been a great refresher on all the content, I've actually learned about how I think, process, and do.</p>

                    <p>Humans are marvelous creatures. We can create, learn, adapt, and do some pretty awesome things. Though we have made incredible moves forward from our fire making days, there is one human element that has and never will change: the human error. Human error doesn’t need to be something complicated, rather, its the most simplest of concepts. We humans make errors all the time, and thats completely okay and normal. So what? Well my point is to prove that computers/technology is here to help remove our human error. Computers are pretty freaking cool when you know what to tell them, and just how to tell them.</p>

                    <p>We’ve all heard it. "I want my site to look good." Or - "We must have the best designed site to stand out." I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve heard "can you fix the padding?" Its always some phrase to stress the importance of good design. Well, what exactly is good design? Does it really matter?</p>

                    <h4>03/21/2015</h4>
                    <p>Corporate, cut throat, narrow minded, or age favoring systems. These words describe any and all of the cultural experiences I have had in the workplace. It is unfortunate that so many systems focus more on the end result versus the process, creating a cultural black hole along the way. DBC is a fantastic learning experience that offers so much more than just "a package", as Shareef emphasized. At DBC, culture is everything; and in my mind, that is the front runner for the key to happiness in the work place.</p>

                    <h4>03/20/2015</h4>
                    <p><strong>Play-Doh</strong>. Weird feeling, malleable, and cold, Play-doh infinitesimally fed the imagination. Like legos, Play-Doh was amongst the greatest hands on inventions of my childhood universe. It was non stop; the molding, mashing, building, sometimes eating, and always growing playtime. The greatest thing about Play-Doh was the very fact that I could sculpture anything I wanted. It didn't need to fit into other pieces, didn’t need to be a certain shape, nor did it need to even make sense. All that mattered was pushing it onto the next piece, and continuously marvel at my ever growing creation.</p>
