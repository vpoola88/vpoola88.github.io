    Close Relationships

    Your
    Effectiveness

    Values
    Achievement

    Without value, theres nothing. This is an ideal my father has always instilled in me. The value to help, the value to grow, or the value to affect have always been my familieis guiding message. This week DBC has asked us to reflect on our own values. Though I feel I/we may have many, here are the few that have always stood out to me from my family and the world within.

    The values that stand out to me the most are: close relationship, effectivness, and acheiement. I feel that these values encompass what my family has influenced me with, as well as my genuin personality. 

    Taking a leap of faith into this next chapter of life isnt so easy, especially when we dont have a stable job/life to manage all the time. This decision was one that weighed on my, and one I felt I have played with back and forth. But the time has finally come, and leaving work and the world out there to focus on me is exciting and scary.

    With that in mind, its really important to continu to reflect on my values and to live by them. Close relationships have always been incredibly important to me. To those of you reading this, you know how much friendship means to me. It may not always come off like that, but friends/family make and break my happiness everyday. I'm excited to continue and make more close relationships in my next chapter at DBC.

    Effectiveness and Achievement go hand in hand. I want to know that I am being effective with wherever/whatever my part is. If I'm working in a team, I cant be the guy thats replacable. I want my value to be real value - and the only way to do that is to achieve. By acheiving, I can learn and become that more effective, valued asset. I hope to acheive that as well with my knowledge from DBC.

    Though these values are mine, I've come to notice that friends walking similar paths may feel the same. I've been asked about how to move forward with things like leaving work to go into freelance, startups, or development in general, and effectiveness/acheivement always stand out to me the most. Be effective by achieving, and you will be more important than ever.
