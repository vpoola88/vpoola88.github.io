        The stereotype threat is one that we all most likely face at some point or another. Its meaning refers to a negative stereotype of a specific group - something we individually try and not meet. Though we all know sterotypes and probably use them ourselves, it something that we can unfortunately never escape. So what does stereotype have to do with anything we are learning at dev bootcamp, rather, whats the point of talking about this now?

My entire educational life has been strangled by expectations. Theres never been a point where comparisons have not been drawn between me and those of my cultural background, on top of which generalizations from outside ethnicities have been made. Needelss to say, I've personally felt similarities to the stereotype threat.

Its difficult for us to distance ourselves from what we are expected to do. Though tech is a nutriout bound world, it isnt one without shortcomings. As a brown skinned person, I am generalized with working computer support/IT, as well as taking jobs away from the US. Both stereotypes were difficult for me to fight through as I reached out for more projects in the tech world. 

When you think tech support - undoubtedly an Indian guy is one of the characters that might come into your head.

Technology is fascinated because its more than just who we are will be what we do - its about what we can build is what we can do.
