        <p>The stereotype threat is one that we all most likely face at some point or another. Its meaning refers to a negative stereotype of a specific group - something we individually try and not meet. Though we all know stereotypes and probably use them ourselves, it something that we can unfortunately never escape. So what does stereotype have to do with anything in tech, rather, whats the point of talking about this now?</p>


        <p>"The I.T. guy is coming in."</p>
        <p>Its crazy that the above sentence paints different images in our heads, but more often than not, it will paint a stereotypical one.</p>

        <p>My entire educational life has been strangled by expectations. Theres never been a point where comparisons have not been drawn between me and those of my cultural background. On top of  that,  generalizations from outside ethnicities have also always influenced my path. Being brown and in a family of doctors (with an under-privileged past), I was expected to go into medicine, or meet the outside norm of I.T. or another generalized tech field.</p>

        <p>The expectations were difficult to oversee. I wasn't the same as my other friends. Becoming a doctor was not for me. Did this make me a failure? That thought always ruminated in my head. As many of my friends from the same cultural background were accepted into med school, the constant rumblings in my community were only questions to my parents: "What is your son doing?" My father, unsure of the validity and importance of web development, would always respond that I was going into Computer Engineering. Now, those of us with some understand of these fields know how different they are, but that was the acceptable answer, and what we went with.</p>

        <p>I would come to realize that I shouldn't give in to cultural norms. Stereotypes don't mean shit, and they don't affect tomorrow. I would move forward, still unsure about my path, but with invigorated energy that whatever I did would be exceptional. As I continued development, my work would get noticed. Nothing crazy, but the fact that I can proudly show my resume of projects proved to those that deemed it wrong, that it wasn't.</p>

        <p>I can't even describe how much personal out come means everything. If I could share some advice from my minuscule stories of internal battles, it would be to not care what anyone but the person in the mirror wants. Seriously. Someone somewhere will look at what you do, and think its not right or not good enough, or worse, that you <i>cant do it</i>. Don't give a flying f***. Its about you.</p>

        <p>Now, my story isn't as significant as bringing stereotypes into the work place - but I hope it empathizes with those that see it at home or community. DBC is here to show us that labels are stupid. We are all cooks in this kitchen, and thats the only generalization that matters.</p>
