Culture is everything.

This is a hard one. Though some of us are new and unknowing, culture is just as important as the next best idea. Dane Atknsons, founder of SumAll, says it the best: "Culture is creating an environment in which your team members are owners of the process, so they're dedicated to the team in a different fashion." This might have different meanings to all of you, but whatever the interpretation may be, culture is a growing disconnect in the tech industry.

Now, to be honest, this specific topic is incredibly difficult to stay on point about (so I'm going to be everywhere in this post). I can't even begin to describe how I see companies that think they are startups attempt to create their own fake culture, only to see it falter when shit hits the fan.

Though this world has so many other issues, I'm choosing to focus on culture because it is what I have seen fail time and time again. More often then not, the start of the company is great. The promise of the green, and your idea to drive it there as CEO is the utmost tech world capitalistic dream. Who doesn't wanna make some good dough, and make some sick as hell websites along the way? The problem here is that once you try to scale, things dont look so green as they did before. Fingers point, hours change, turn out increases, and what was so anti corporate to being with has just turned into more corporate than corporate. That made sense...right?

So what do we do? I want to start a company, how can I make sure we have ping pong tables, a kegerator, and that work gets done without being a Nazi?

So many resources exist that claim to give you the best recipe for a startup environment, but I'm going to preach some insider information I've been given from Ideo and from Stanford's very own GSB (who turns out more successful CEO's and founders than I can count.)

Understand tech - To some of you reading this that have worked with me before, we know what its like to work with people that dont understand quality development. I'm sure a ton of companies were founded on a tech basis with no technical knowledge in a CEO, but we can't have that anymore. Its few and far between that we see success without this first rule. Understand tech, you will somewhat understand what it takes to build your product.

Keep to your values - don't fake em.

Hire Exceptional, not cheap.

Awesome work environment means awesome work.

Talk.

This last one is bigger than anything. Transparency in the work place is crucial. The moment you feel internally that your happiness isn't there, that this or that should change, is the moment you've said goodbye to your current path.

Culture is so open ended. Theres so much more that needs to be said about this, but I wanted the chance to rant about how I see it fail again and again. I can't wait to be in a world where this is valued, I am valued, and our work is more than extraordinary. Ping pong tables and anti 9-5 is nice as well.
