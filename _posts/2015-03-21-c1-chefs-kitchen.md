title: Cultural Change

Corporate, cut throat, narrow minded, or age favoring systems. These words describe any and all of the cultural experiences I have had in the workplace. It is unfortunate that so many systems focus more on the end result versus the process, creating a cultural black hole along the way. DBC is a fantastic learning experience that offers so much more than just "a package", as Shareef emphasized. At DBC, culture is everything; and in my mind, that is the front runner for the key to happiness in the work place.

The ideal of a creator mindset, staying hungry and kind, and understand how this experiment and experience is won together with hard work and culture is my greatest drive to attend DBC. My impression of DBC is best encompassed by these words "My religion is very simple. My religion is Kindness" - Dali Lama. And I feel that the experience here will grant me more than just the ability to code, but live meaningfully, kind-fully, and culturally.

As Shareef stated - we need to go through this experience hungry, ready and with full force. By immersing myself in the yoga, mindfulness, and body form of developmental learning,I will reach my drive to a new cultural realm.

I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous, nor intimidated by the work load awaiting me. But knowing that I am going in this with a full kitchen of other cooks definitely helps to ease the nerves. I'm so excited to learn about self awareness, mindfulness, and kindness - and of course, become an incredible developer.
