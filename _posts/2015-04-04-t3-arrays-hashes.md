Humans are marvelous creatures. We can create, learn, adapt, and do some pretty awesome things. Though we have made incredible moves forward from our fire making days, there is one human element that has and never will change: the human error. Human error doesn’t need to be something complicated, rather, its the most simplest of concepts. We humans make errors all the time, and thats completely okay and normal. So what? Well my point is to prove that computers/technology is here to help remove our human error. Computers are pretty freaking cool when you know what to tell them, and just how to tell them.

So lets talk about why using tech matter, other than playing flappy bird.

Arrays

Ever been to the grocery store to get things ya need, only to go home, carry all the bags in, and realize that you forgot the milk? We've all been there. If only something existed to fit in our pockets and have a list of groceries that we could go through as we shopped huh? Well... in comes Arrays. Arrays are existent in all forms of programming and the outside world. When you pull out your massive iPhone 6 plus, open the notes app, and start typing in your grocery list, you are in essence creating your own array.

Alright, lets be more specific. An array is just a list of items. So, on your notes app, you have a specific list for groceries, and items under that list. This is specifically an array of groceries! So, it would look something like this:

<pre>
Groceries = ["Milk", "Coco-Pebbles,", "Fruity-Pebbles", "Oreos", "Grilled Chicken", "Raman"]
</pre>
Quite the list we have here; all the essentials. Any who, you now have the knowledge to create your own arrays! An Array can contain any string or integer, or combo there of.

Hashes

So your probably thinking that Arrays are pretty cool right? Awesome, I know I am! Lists are great to use and all, but I think we are pretty confident in learning other applications for our handy dandy computers that are in and out of our pockets. Lets talk about contact lists, because we all don't carry rolodex’s in our pockets anymore. (Was that thing?). The contact list is actually pretty awesome, because it can be more than just a list of numbers. Maybe we want to have emails, addresses, facebooks, etc for our contact right? Its always nice having more than one way to invite someone to a Raman dinner.

Hashes are essentially arrays that allow your items to have a key - value relationship. What this means is that each item in your list can have a key assigned to it. So, with our contact list, you obviously want to have First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email, and etc. Lets learn how we would do that using Ruby and writing a Hash.

<pre>
Person = { firstname => "Vivek", lastname => "Poola", email => "vpoola88@gmail.com", address => "DeathStar" }
</pre>

Here - we can verify that a hash is awesome for giving your list specific keys. So, if we have a list of a name, we can assign the first name a key firstname, and the last name a key lastname, so on and so forth. Its pretty cool

Now we all know how cool computers are, that no ones perfect, and that human error is totally okay.
